Before I wanted to realize myself in IT, my past professions were related to the repair and painting of cars, in a carpentry workshop, apartment renovations and much more. what to do, I love to call this world. I was also interested in computers, but I did not dare to connect my life with development. I practiced assembling system blocks, installing windows and programs, resolving issues with bugs and lags.
