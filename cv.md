# Briefly About Myself:

Before I wanted to realize myself in IT, my past professions were related to the repair and painting of cars, in a carpentry workshop, apartment renovations and much more. what to do, I love to call this world. I was also interested in computers, but I did not dare to connect my life with development. I practiced assembling system blocks, installing windows and programs, resolving issues with bugs and lags. Repaired computers for friends. Stitched phones and much more. With age and the current situation in the world, I want to radically change my life.
